My app to calculate incomes,profits and taxes to pay as driver.

Input takes as values Incomes shown in application UberDriver/BoltDriver and shows how much taxes You need to pay, how much You earned in this week and how much money company needs to send to You.

First feature is option to choose company. It affects taxes, because Uber takes 25% from incomes, and Bolt takes 20%.

In the future I plan to make more features, such as choose option of few values.At this moment it counts with Polish tax threshold.
